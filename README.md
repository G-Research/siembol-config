# siembol-config

To get started with [Siembol](https://siembol.io/), you'll need a couple of things. Among them, you'll need a repo like this one to store the configuration for Siembol over time.  

You can either use a single repository for the whole shebang, or you can set up separate repositories for each service and even use separate repositories to differentiate between the store and the release configs.

If you want to demo [Siembol](https://siembol.io/) please fork this repository and follow the [Siembol quick start guide](https://github.com/G-Research/siembol/blob/main/docs/introduction/how-tos/quickstart.md)
